## App Description (for the listing page)

### Turn browsers into buyers with delivery date confidence.

Customers abandon carts when they don't know when their order will arrive. 
Delivery Date Estimator solves this instantly by showing a clear estimated 
delivery date and a live countdown timer on every product page.

**"Order within 2h 15m to get it by Friday, Feb 20"**

That single line increases conversions by creating urgency and building trust.

### How it works:
- Set your order cutoff time, processing days, and shipping speed
